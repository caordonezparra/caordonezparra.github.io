As a seed ecologist, I am concerned about the lack of awareness about seeds and their importance in nature and our societies. Therefore, I've written different kinds of pieces to share recent seed science studies and the researchers. Some of these pieces include graphical abstracts and infographics that pretend to summarise the papers or their key concepts in a more succinct and (hopefully) aesthetic fashion.

If you have an exciting seed science story and want me to write something about it, feel free to [contact me](https://caordonezparra.github.io/contact.html) to discuss it!

### BotanyOne articles
[_BotanyOne_](https://botany.one/) is a weblog by the Annals of Botany Company that produces different pieces to share exciting plant science research. I've contributed with guest posts for them, and since April of 2023 I've been serving as a [Scientific Editor](https://botany.one/2023/04/introducing-carlos-andres-ordonez-parra-our-new-science-editor/). Since that moment, I've been able to work with guest authors from different countries and expertises, helping them to create engaging narratives about exciting plant science stories. Below, you'll find some of the papers I've written so far.

### Plant Science Research Weekly summaries

[Plant Science Research Weekly](https://plantae.org/research/wwrtw/) is the newsletter by Plantae.org -the online community led by the American Society of Plant Biologists- that looks to highlight recent and exciting plant biology research. Since I was a Plantae Fellow (2020), I've written more than 90 summaries about different seed science research, from molecular biology to ecological synthesis. Here you will find a selection of summaries dealling with different topics. You might find the complete list [here](https://plantae.org/author/carlosordonezparra/).

> I edited the [edition](https://plantae.org/plant-science-research-weekly-july-31/) of July 30th, 2020, which included seven papers dealing with seed evolution.
