As a seed ecologist, I am deeply concerned about the limited awareness of seeds and their crucial role in both ecosystems and society. To address this, I have written various articles to highlight recent seed science studies and the researchers behind them. I also create graphical abstracts and infographics that summarise key findings in a succinct and visually engaging way. If you have an interesting seed science story and would like me to write about it, feel free to [reach out](https://caordonezparra.github.io/contact.html)!

### International Society for Seed Science and Seed Science Research

Since 2024, I have been appointed as Communications Officer of the [International Society for Seed Science (ISSS)](https://seedscisoc.org) —a professional and academic society committed to fostering and promoting research, education and communication in the scientific understanding of seeds. In this role, I have been in charge of managing the social media accounts —[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-society-for-seed-science/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/intlsocseedsci.bsky.social)— of the ISSS and its official academic journal, [_Seed Science Research_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/seed-science-research).

In this position, I've conducted interviews with Keynote Speakers of previous ISSS-sponsored conferences and members of the Editorial Board. In 2024, the ISSS also celebrated its 25th Anniversary which we celebrated with a [series of posts](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/celebrating-isss25jubilee-members-posts-bj5de/?trackingId=MnUuDnLt0Cnh66p3lvJnEQ%3D%3D) showcasing members from all over the world, including notable members that lead key moments of our society.

### Botany One

[_BotanyOne_](https://botany.one/) is the official weblog of the [Annals of Botany Company](https://annalsofbotanycompany.co.uk/home-welcome) that aims that that fascinating discoveries about plants can reach and inspire the widest possible audience —from classroom teachers to citizen scientists. I initially contributed as a guest writer and, since April 2023, have served as a [Scientific Editor](https://botany.one/2023/04/introducing-carlos-andres-ordonez-parra-our-new-science-editor/). In this role, I collaborate with researchers from diverse backgrounds, helping them craft compelling narratives about plant science discoveries. Moreover, I conduct interviews with plant scientists from all over the world to show how diverse botanists and the stories behind them are. Below, you’ll find a selection of my favourite articles, and you might find the complete list [here](https://botany.one/author/carlos-a-ordonez-parra/).

### Plant Science Research Weekly

As part of the [Plantae's Fellow Class of 2020](https://plantae.org/announcing-our-2020-class-of-plantae-fellows/) —a program hosted by Plantae.org and the American Society of Plant Biologists— I contributed with 100 research summaries for its newsletter [Plant Science Research Weekly](https://plantae.org/research/wwrtw/). These summaries coverered a myriad of seed science topics from molecular biology to ecological synthesis. Below is a selection of summaries on various topics, and you can find the full list [here](https://plantae.org/author/carlosordonezparra/). I also edited the July 30th, 2020 edition, which featured seven papers on seed evolution.
