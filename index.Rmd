Hello, my name is [Carlos (he/him)](https://caordonezparra.github.io/about.html), and I am a PhD student at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte, Brazil). **Welcome to my website!** Here, you will find some information about my work and academic interests.

I am a seed ecologist, and my research focuses on the role of seed and germination traits in the natural regeneration and community assembly of tropical ecosystems. I'm also interested in science decolonization, making science more inclusive and equitable, science communication and data visualization.

I am a member of the [Ecology and Environmental Solutions Lab](https://eeslufmg.weebly.com/) and the [Centre of Ecological Synthesis and Conservation](https://twitter.com/for_synthesis) at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. Please visit the lab's website for more information about our work.
